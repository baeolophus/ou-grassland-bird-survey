Data sheet issues

In spreadsheet, but not found in physical data sheets:
-Everything for observer "Randy"
-05/30/2014 Roy, 1 point count at Rita Blanca NG (two sheets of transects exist but I cannot find the data on those, so I assume it is on another sheet.)

Not found in spreadsheet
point counts
5/18/2014 Tory/TES, Selman Ranch, no GPS, 7:25 and 7:55am pt4 and pt ??

4/21/2014 Jessica, Tall Grass Prairie Preserve, points not named (almost looks like transect?  but labeled PC) and no gps points.
6/08/2014 Jessica, Cimarron Hills, points 2, 7, 5, 9, 1, 12.  time 16:00-18:04: too late in day? also wind 20-25 mph.


Wichita Mtns points confused, will sort.  some have same numbers which will mess up connecting lat/long and times to sightings.


transects
6/04/2014 Jessica, Tall Grass Prairie Preserve, transect B, no lat/long given.
6/05/2014 Jessica, Tall Grass Prairie Preserve, transect D, all data appears to be present, but not entered.  no reason given.  Maybe thunderstorm?  it says "break for bad thunder/lightning".

6/18/2014 Roy/RFF, Cimarron Hills, points 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 18.  time 15:58-17:47: too late in day?
