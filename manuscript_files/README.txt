Description for each file or group of files:
	pointcount.csv
		Missing data as "NA".
		
		from datadryad.org "key of definitions of variable names, column headings and row labels, data codes (including missing data), and measurement units, type(s) of data included (e.g, categorical, time-series, geospatial, human subjects, etc.)"
	transect.csv
		Missing data as "NA".
	pointcount_metadata.csv
		Missing data as "NA".
	transect_metadata.csv
		Missing data as "NA".
	preparation_steps.zip
		Contains the code required to process data files (pointcount.csv, transect.csv, pointcount_metadata.csv, transect_metdata.csv, and ebird data) into the format used in the SEEM_model.zip code.
		No de-identification was necessary on the data and all original variables were retained in the dataset files, though not included in all analyses.
	SEEM_model.zip
		run_from_here.R causes all other files prefixed with source_*.R to run.
		results_*.R files generate the tables and figures numbered x, y, z.
