- elevation
- (extended analysis) neighbors
- presence/absence
- moderate/strong
- graded response (standard rubric for songbird agression?)

- (extended analysis) other species detected during PCs

- model analysis (AIC)
- NOTE: Black Mesa had fence along northern row (within 20m)

- literature for territory size and prior veg survey examples for analysis

- density of CASP from PCs. Index of agression (is it related to density?). Regress agressive response by density at site.

- need to check if density needs to be corrected

Protocol:
- playback - song then immediate agressive call - 30s obs 
- speaker held along transect (E-W) at full volume (held above head at XXm)
- notes of agressive behaviors
- point counts were conducted AFTER the playback

- veg plots assoc. w/ most agressive or spread out areas of absence
