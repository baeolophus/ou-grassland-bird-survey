This folder contains the standardized field photos taken at survey points within the 5 x 5 grids evaluated for CASP territorial behavior by point (incl. vegetation and ground cover data).

Photos were to be taken in the following order: North, East, South, West, and directly downward (with field notebook as size standard). All photos are timestamped and georeferenced by GPS positioning embedded into the properties of the image file.
All photos were to be uploaded to the EOMF.ou.edu webportal for archiving and sharing with other researchers.

Some general landscape and/or action shots may be included in the photos.
